# Tab Completion

Use tab completion when running git commands.

Add this to your bash profile:
```
source ~/git-completion.bash
```

And save [this file](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash) under your home directory.

Next time you need to checkout a branch, start typing `git co <name_of_branch>` but hit TAB after entering the first few letters of the branch name.
