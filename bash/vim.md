# Vim

Turn on syntax highlighting in VIM

Open a file using Vim from the terminal:
```
vim somefile.swift
```

To turn on syntax highlighting, issue this command in Vim:
```
:syntax on
```

Better yet, add this to your .vimrc so all files will have syntax highlighting:
```
syntax on
```

Note: the above example attempts to open a swift file which does not have syntax highlighting support out of the box. To get syntax highlighting, see [this link](https://github.com/keith/swift.vim).
